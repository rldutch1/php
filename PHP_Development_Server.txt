PHP Development Server
PHP contains simple web server which can be used instead of full-featured web server. It is intended to be used only for development, not for a production environment.

You can start PHP development server by typing this in your projectâ€™s root:

$ sudo php --server localhost:8080 --docroot  .
Server will be accessible on http://localhost:8080/.
