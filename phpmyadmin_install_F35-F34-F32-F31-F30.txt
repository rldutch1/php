In this guide, we will look at how to Install and Configure phpMyAdmin on Fedora 35/34/32/31/30. PHPMyAdmin is an open source software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web interface.

phpMyAdmin has support for a wide range of operations on MySQL, MariaDB, and Drizzle. It is often used to perform common Database operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) through an intuitive and easy to use web interface.

Follow the steps below to Install phpMyAdmin on Fedora35/34/32/31/30.
Step 1: Install Apache HTTP Server and PHP

Apache HTTP server and PHP are required dependencies for phpMyAdmin. Install them first :

sudo dnf -y install httpd php php-cli php-php-gettext php-mbstring php-mcrypt php-mysqlnd php-pear php-curl php-gd php-xml php-bcmath php-zip

Configure httpd basic settings:

Edit the configuration file /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and set:

ServerAdmin admin@example.com
ServerName  example.com
ServerTokens Prod

You can optionally set Keepalive:

KeepAlive On

Enable and start httpd service:

sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

If you have firewalld running, allow both http and https services:

sudo firewall-cmd --add-service={http,https} --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Confirm your installed PHP version:

$ php -v
PHP 7.3.4 (cli) (built: Apr  2 2019 13:48:50) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.3.4, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies

Loaded extensions can be viewed by passing -m option to the phpcommand

$ php -m

Set PHP timezone on the file /etc/php.ini

date.timezone = Africa/Nairobi

See a complete List of Supported Timezones.
Step 2: Install and configure phpMyAdmin on Fedora 35/34/32/31/30

After PHP and Apache have been installed, you can install phpMyAdmin

sudo dnf -y install phpMyAdmin

Summary     : Handle the administration of MySQL over the World Wide Web
Description :
phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of
MySQL over the World Wide Web. Most frequently used operations are supported
by the user interface (managing databases, tables, fields, relations, indexes,
users, permissions), while you still have the ability to directly execute any
SQL statement.

Features include an intuitive web interface, support for most MySQL features
(browse and drop databases, tables, views, fields and indexes, create, copy,
drop, rename and alter databases, tables, fields and indexes, maintenance
server, databases and tables, with proposals on server configuration, execute,
edit and bookmark any SQL-statement, even batch-queries, manage MySQL users
and privileges, manage stored procedures and triggers), import data from CSV
and SQL, export data to various formats: CSV, SQL, XML, PDF, OpenDocument Text
and Spreadsheet, Word, Excel, LATEX and others, administering multiple servers,
creating PDF graphics of your database layout, creating complex queries using
Query-by-example (QBE), searching globally in a database or a subset of it,
transforming stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions,
like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link and much more...

Limit access to phpMyAdmin to your only trusted networks

sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf.d/phpMyAdmin.conf

Edit the Require ip lines â€“ both on Line 17 and 34 of the file.

Require ip 127.0.0.1 192.168.18.0/24

Save the changes and restart httpd service

sudo systemctl restart httpd

Step 3: Access phpMyAdmin interface

Access  [http://(your hostname or IP address)/phpmyadmin/] from your favorite web browser and network whitelisted.
install phpmyadmin fedora 29 fedora 28 login page

Login with your Database user to start administering database operations from phpMyAdmin web interface.
Step 4: Change Authentication Plugin for MySQL 8.0

To be able to authenticate to MySQL 8.0, login to MySQL CLI and change  Authentication Plugin.

$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 26

Bye

Enjoy administering your MySQL or MariaDB database server with phpMyAdmin.
