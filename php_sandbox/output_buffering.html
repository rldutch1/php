	<p>You were redirected to this page by PHP. Output buffering is turned off on the server so I had to manually turn it on.
	<ul>Output buffering is manually turned on by using both
	<b>	<li>ob_start(); 
		<li>ob_end_flush();
	</b><br /> 
	in the PHP tags. Output buffering allows PHP to load the entire page before displaying it. </ul>
